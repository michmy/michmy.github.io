    <h2>About Project</h2>
    <p>I coded emails that were sent to potential recruiting firms about applicants they received on OneWire's behalf. Worked with the UX Designer to ensure the email would scale appropriately on smaller screens. The email is a digest of the candidates' skillset, education and years of experience.</p>
