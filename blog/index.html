  I'm surprised my site hosted on verizon is still running and still showing up in search results when you google my name! i've closed my ekizmet.com domain.

<p>i've been testing out <a href="http://jason.diamond.name/weblog/2005/07/06/my-ajax-dot-net-library">My Ajax.NET</a> - pretty cool stuff.
i found some additional articles regarding the usability of AJAX:
    
</p>
<ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.baekdal.com/articles/Usability/XMLHttpRequest-guidelines/">XMLHttpRequest Usability Guidelines</a></li>

        <li><a href="http://www.softwareas.com/ajax-patterns">Design Patterns for AJAX Usability</a></li>
    </ul>

<h2>September 22, 2005</h2>
<p>AJAX - it's been a fad technology - google uses it with several of their beta apps (gmail, google maps), microsoft uses it (outlook web access, start.com), flickr uses it, the list goes on. you can read more about ajax at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">wikipedia</a>.
how web accessible is it though? an <a href="http://www.standards-schmandards.com/index.php?2005/03/01/16-ajax-and-accessibility">article at standards-schmandards</a> does a great job in listing the pros and cons of using AJAX.

    I had to figure out how to change the background color of a selected item in a RadioButtonList. But because of a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q309338">bug</a>, attributes that are added to a ListItem are not rendered.
    so the best way is to derive your own custom RadioButtonList. digging through google groups, i found a <a href="works/customRBL.html">solution</a>.</p>
    
<h2>September 15, 2005</h2>
<p>
	At work, we have a custom datagrid (derived control). we implement it in a similar way that's detailed in this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/10/cutting/default.aspx">article</a>. 
	a weird thing was happening with sorting when we set the SortCommand in the code-in-front:
	<code>&lt;uc1:CustomGrid OnSortCommand="MySortEvent"&gt;</code> there was a delay in sorting; assume we have a grid with the following columns:
	ID, Name, Department. Initially it's sorted by ID, when I go to click Department, the current SortExpression is still ID. Then when I go to click Name, it's the previous SortExpression, Department (the column I clicked last).
	In our custom datagrid, we wire up the control-level SortCommand in the overridded OnInit event. The article says to wire events in the constructor; following this suggestion, the sorting problem went away.
	the thing I don't quite get is that the sorting problem only occurs when we set the event in the page-level's code-in-front; the article does say "setting default properties in places other than the control's constructor make the control insensitive to the 
	external, tag-level settings" - maybe that somehow caused the weird delay?
</p>
<h2>September 12, 2005</h2>
<p>I've been working on asp.net themes and skins. when i tried theming a custom derived control, the theme wouldn't take. then i realized to theme custom server controls, you have to add the Register directive in the skin file. You declare the control in the skin file with the same tagprefix you used to declare the control in the aspx page.
Before figuring that out on my own, i had posted a question about it. my question was answered at this <a href="http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2005/09/01/2145.aspx">blog post</a>.
</p>
<h2>August 29, 2005</h2>
<p>
	i downloaded this helpful Firefox extension called <a href="http://www.standards-schmandards.com/index.php?show/fangs">Fangs</a>. it's a screen reader emulator that creates a textual representation of a web page as if it were read
	by a screen reader. i discovered this tool while reading on <a href="http://www.standards-schmandards.com/index.php?2005/08/16/17-accessibility-in-aspnet">how to improve accessibility in asp.net 1.1</a>.
</p>

	"Huynh" is another layout based on my boyfriend's photo as a kid (Huynh is his last name). I like the background pattern a lot - courtesy of
	<a href="http://www.squidfingers.com/patterns">squidfingers</a>, many other pretty patterns can be found there.
</p>-->

<h2>August 5, 2005</h2>
<p>
	i've been reading about the new code-behind model in asp.net 2.0. it made me realize asp.net 1.x's code-behind model has some issues.
	the code-behind contains control declarations and event handlers (which would sometimes un-wire themselves when you switch between Design and HTML view). this code-behind would then
	be compiled to a dll. the aspx page itself is also compiled to a dll that is stored in a temp directory. here we have 2 separate dlls and within the aspx's source code is where controls are
	instantiated. to see what i mean, introduce an error in a script block in an aspx page (ie <code><span style="background:#FFF200; color: #000;">&lt;&#37;</span> this line causes an error <span style="background:#FFF200; color: #000;">&#37;&gt;</span></code>).
	you get the error page - click on "show complete compilation source", you will see that all the controls that were declared in the code-behind are instantiated here. the aspx page
	is instantiating the controls while deriving from the code-behind class.
</p>

<p>
	so now there are partial classes in 2.0 which allow a single class to be defined in multiple source files. this eliminates the 2 separate dlls and the control declarations. you can read about this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/migratingtoaspnet2.asp">new
	code-behind model and other features</a>. Other links:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/codecompilation.asp">New code compilation features in Whidbey</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://dotnet.sys-con.com/read/46997.htm">ASP.NET 1.X and ASP.NET 2.0 Compilation Models</a> - i always prefer to read the <a href="http://dotnet.sys-con.com/read/46997_p.htm">print</a> versions (no ads)</li>
</ul>
<p>the last link above nicely sums up how there are some confusing things with the asp.net 1.x compilation model:</p>
<blockquote>
	There is a complex division of responsibility between the base class (i.e., the code-behind page) and the ASPX page. 
	The event-handling plumbing is done in the code-behind page. If we look at a code-behind file, we see that each and every control that exists on the ASPX file has to be declared in the code-behind file. The ASPX file and the code-behind files have to be kept synchronized. Visual Studio.NET handles this synchronization transparent to the developer. In this model there is a good probability that a developer could accidentally change the ASPX file outside the Visual Studio environment without updating the code-behind file. 
	This would easily bring down a working Web application because of the mismatch between the code-behind and the ASPX pages.

<p>Working near Chelsea Market definitely has its rewards. i've been fortunate to have eaten at several restaurants around the area (through company lunches and dinner) and i thought to make a list of them.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.hogpit.com">The Hog Pit</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.restaurantflorent.com">Florent</a> - i like the concept of the "Working Girl's Lunch"</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.pastisny.com">Pastis</a> - the steak sandwich is the best!</li>
</ul>
<p>there are also some stores that i've been to recently where the stuff is really good:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.li-lacchocolates.com">Li-Lac</a> - i love the raspberry creme pattie</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.jimmysgelato.com">Jimmy's Gelato</a> - my favorites so far are the watermelon sorbet and the cantelope sorbet</li>

<p>i finally know the difference between sorbet and sherbets. sherbets has dairy (includes milk and eggs) while sorbets has ice and fruit (no dairy). i like sorbets more :)</p>

good practices for writing JavaScript in 2005</a>.</p>

<p> some .NET info he'll find useful as well - what the
AssociatedControlID property of ASP.NET's <code>&lt;asp:label&gt;</code>
control can do. <code>&lt;asp:label runat="server"&gt;</code>
outputs a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> on the
browser. To output the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>
element, use the AssociatedControlID property.</p>

<p>By adding the property AssociatedControlID and setting it to
the id of a form control, the HTML <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>
element with the "for" attribute will render and will be set to the id
of the associated form control. When users click the label, focus
passes to the associated control (ie a textbox, a drop-down, a
checkbox, or a radiobutton)</p>

<p>this is another sample of my work. i had to implement a tab
styled menu where the selected tab would be larger than the rest. i
tried it the first time using unordered lists, then tried it with
tables. the html markup was definitely cleaner when using lists than
using tables. plus it's more accessible with lists. both look
identical. see the <a href="works/tabs.html">code</a>.</p>

<h2>March 31, 2005</h2>

<p>had to implement some nested lists where the first level item
was bold, second level's ID number (only the number) bold, and the
third level item with colored bullets. these lists were generated
through recursion using c# - to format them as simply as possible, i
set class names for &lt;ul&gt; tags and added some
&lt;span&gt; tags. this is the <a href="works/list.html">code</a>.</p>
